1. To run the code

	cc -o scheduler -O scheduler.c scimark/*.c
	./scheduler test.conf logfile.log

2. Config file

	- Algorithm: Algorithm to use (unsigned int)
		0 = Baseline
		1 = STH
		2 = STD
	- Activation Threshold:  degrees celcius at which to activate scheduler (unsigned int) (STD, STH)
	- STD Threshold:  gradient threshold for std approach (double) (STD)
	- STH Threshold:  temperature threshold for sth approach (unsigned int) (STH)
	- Polling Interval:  time in microseconds to sleep between polling temperature (unsigned int) (Baseline, STD, STH)
	- Sleeping Interval:  time in microseconds to sleep between benchmark process (unsigned int) (STD, STH)
	- Core Affinity: the logical processor to use (unsigned int)
		0 or 2 = physical core 0
		1 or 3 = physical core 1
		4 = any core

3. Description

	There are two main processes, the benchmark process and the scheduler process. The benchmark process
runs the scimark benchmark and listens for a sleep signal from the scheduler thread in case it gets hot. This
process can be pinned to a core or can be free to run on any core. 

	The scheduler process periodically polls the temperature at a rate of the polling interval and determines 
whether or not to sleep the benchmark process based on the temperatures gathered and algorithm chosen. This process 
has no affinity set.
